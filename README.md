# X-Plane plugin APIs for Rust

## Purpose

This library provides convenient Rust interfaces to the [X-Plane plugin APIs](http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/mediawiki/Main_Page).

With this library, X-Plane plugins can be easily developed in Rust. Because this library uses SDK version 3.0,
plugins created with this library support X-Plane 11.10 or later.

## Status

This library is incomplete. GUI components need a good API design.
